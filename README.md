# Prioritize
Project for HooHacks 2024

Have you ever had too many tasks on hand that you don't know where to start? Let Prioritize help you! Enter a list of tasks that needs to be completed, separate them into different categories, and when you have time, choose a category that you want to do. The app will select a task for you to complete. Enter more times for better recommendations! You could also reject the app's suggestions and enter your own timetable.
